## A simple CRUD api written in Go

API has implementation of "GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE" http methods, allowing to Create, Read, Update and Delete objects in database via json input.

## Status

It`s not a recommended or even the correct way of doing a CRUD api of such sort, I'm just practicing
